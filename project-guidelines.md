## Project Guidelines
1. Follow Git best practices
    - One person create repo
    - Everyone else clone it
    - Create branch for feature
    - Try to work on separate files
    - Commit often, pull every day
        - Name your commits well
    - Make pull requests when tasks are complete
        - Add testing steps so code reviewer can make sure it works right
        - PRs are good places to have conversation, add suggestions.
2. Kanban boards (trello or whiteboard)
    - Columns for:
        - Wishlist
        - Todo
        - In Progress
        - Blocked
        - Testing (create pull request, reviewer pulls down branch) 
        - Done (merged to master)
3. Write out tasks for everything
    - Break into as small logical pieces as you can
        - This allows you to always have the feeling of progress, and you have less dependency on giant tasks getting done
    - There should probably never be more than one component built into 
    - As you work on things that are dependent on others, make up fake data that you can fill in with the other part when it comes
        - This requires relying on communicating with your teammates to know in what format to expect the data (string?, object?, array?, etc).
    - They don't have to be perfect--just a starting place. You can always add more tasks l8r.
4. Work on skeleton together, to reduce merge conflicts
    - Good place to decide on naming conventions.
5. Pick up tasks as you complete others.
    - It's great to focus on the ones you feel strong at and understand well, but also
